# discord-music-bot
## Description
A rudimentary Discord bot that plays music from YouTube, and does a few other things for fun. This was primarily created due to the dwindling amount of otherwise popular Discord bots that dropped support for playing YouTube audio.

Currently runs on discord.js v.13.6.0.


## Current stretch goals: 
1. Play things from Spotify/~~Soundcloud~~
   - ~~Can play SoundCloud links and playlists~~
   - Can play Spotify links and playlists
2. Implement other general functionality 
   - At least one minigame
   - Server administration
